# Arabic-Sign-Language-Translation-using-Deep-Learning

This project focuses on building a real-time sign language gesture recognition system using the [MediaPipe Holistic](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/holistic.html) model for keypoint extraction and training deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, Transformer) for gesture classification.
